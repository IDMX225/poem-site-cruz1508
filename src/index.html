      <p> I will not have the mad Clytie,<br>
          Whose head is turned by the sun;<br>
          The tulip is a courtly queen,<br>
          Whom, therefore, I will shun;<br>
          The cowslip is a country wench,<br>
          The violet is a nun; -<br>
          But I will woo the dainty rose,<br>
          The queen of every one.<br> </p>
      <p> The pea is but a wanton witch,<br>
          In too much haste to wed,<br>
          And clasps her rings on every hand;<br>
          The wolfsbane I should dread;<br>
          Nor will I dreary rosemarye,<br>
          That always mourns the dead; -<br>
          But I will woo the dainty rose,<br>
          With her cheeks of tender red.<br> </p>
      <p> The lily is all in white, like a saint,<br>
          And so is no mate for me -<br>
          And the daisy's cheek is tipped with a blush,<br>
          She is of such low degree;<br>
          Jasmine is sweet, and has many loves,<br>
          And the broom's betroth'd to the bee; -<br>
          But I will plight with the dainty rose,<br>
          For fairest of all is she.<br> </p> </div>
